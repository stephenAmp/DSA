BINARY SEARCH - Effective with sorted arrays or continuous functions
Involves dividing input size into two if search target is in left ignore right
if in right ignore left. Saves time  Time complexity of O(logn)
STEPS
- Calculate middle index of the list: (lowest index + highest index) / 2
- if value of middle index is greater than target, ignore the  right half of the list
- if value of middle index is less than trget, ignore left half of the list
- Repeat these steps until length of search interval becomes less or equal to 1
- Check if data[left] equals target. if yes target value is acquired. Else target value does not exist in list.

With a clear understanding of binary search, we can now use it to solve a complex problem â€” searching for a target element in a rotated sorted list. This involves figuring out the rotation point and applying binary search accordingly.

Consider a list like this [7, 8, 9, 2, 3, 4]. This list was sorted from 2 to 9, but then it was rotated to the fourth position. Suppose we want to search for the number 3. We can see that it's in the latter half, but how does our algorithm determine this?"""

ADVANCED PROBLEMS

Problem 1: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
Imagine a sorted array of integers that has been rotated at an unknown pivot point. This list maintains its sorted order but now starts from a random position. Your task is to find a specific target value within this array and return its index. If the target isn't present, return -1.

For example, the initial sorted array could be [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 15], but after a single rotation it'd become [8, 9, 11, 15, 1, 2, 4, 5].

Example Application: Picture a server system where processes are listed in ascending order based on their IDs. Suppose a disruption rotates this list. Now, the system needs to find a process using a specific ID. A standard binary search isn't sufficient as the list, though sorted, starts at an arbitrary point.

Naive Approach: A straightforward solution involves scanning each element in the array until we find a match or exhaust the list. This linear search approach is simple but computationally expensive for large lists

Problem 2: Locate the First and Last Position of an Element in a Sorted Array
In this problem, you are tasked with finding both the first and last positions of a certain target value in a sorted array. If the target is not found within the array, your function should return [-1, -1].

Example Application: To make this problem more relatable, picture a situation involving time-series analysis. For instance, you have a sorted array filled with timestamps of user activities. A user could perform the same activity multiple times, and your task is to determine the first and last instance that a particular activity was performed.

Simplistic Approach: An immediate solution could involve scanning the entire array while taking note of the first and last appearances of the target. Although this method is sound and would yield the correct result, it is far from efficient. This linear search approach could result in a worst-case time complexity of O(n)

Problem 3: Find or Define Insert Position in a Sorted List
Our task is to find or determine the index where a target should be inserted in a sorted integer list. Visualize a librarian's task of adding a new book to a properly arranged shelf. We'll do a similar thing but with numbers in a sorted list.

Example Application: To give this problem real-world relevance, picture a document management system where reports are sorted based on their IDs. Suppose a new report comes in, and it has to be placed in the correct position based on its ID. Here, our task mirrors the system's behavior - placing a number correctly in a sorted list.

Simplistic Approach: A basic solution might involve a left-to-right scan of the array, comparing each element with the target until we encounter an element that matches the target (where we return the index), or one that's larger (where we return the current index as that's the insertion point of our target). This approach, however, is inefficient as it demands a full scan of the array in worst-case scenarios (when the target is larger than every existing item). This results in a linear time complexity of O(n)
O(n), undesirable for gargantuan arrays.
