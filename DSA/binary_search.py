"""
BINARY SEARCH - Effective with sorted arrays or continuous functions
Involves dividing input size into two if search target is in left ignore right
if in right ignore left. Saves time  Time complexity of O(logn)
STEPS
- Calculate middle index of the list: (lowest index + highest index) / 2
- if value of middle index is greater than target, ignore the  right half of the list
- if value of middle index is less than trget, ignore left half of the list
- Repeat these steps until length of search interval becomes less or equal to 1
- Check if data[left] equals target. if yes target value is acquired. Else target value does not exist in list.

"""Bonus Exercise: Binary Search to Solve an Advanced Problem
With a clear understanding of binary search, we can now use it to solve a complex problem â€” searching for a target element in a rotated sorted list. This involves figuring out the rotation point and applying binary search accordingly.

Consider a list like this [7, 8, 9, 2, 3, 4]. This list was sorted from 2 to 9, but then it was rotated to the fourth position. Suppose we want to search for the number 3. We can see that it's in the latter half, but how does our algorithm determine this?"""
